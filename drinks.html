		<p>No meal is complete without the perfect beverage to
			compliment it. Although it's easy to get a glass of water
			wherever you go, I encourage you to try some of these
			beverages the next time you go out to eat at an
			ethnic restaurant!

			<h2>Middle Eastern</h2>
			<p>Growing up, a summer day was never complete without a refreshing
			box of bonjus, a Lebanese orange juice. </p>
			<p>If you ever get invited to a Middle Eastern household, you'll surely
			be offered a cup of Turkish coffee. Don't rinse it when you're done.
			You have to turn the cup upside down and let it dry. The remaining coffee
			stains are used to tell your fortune.</p>
			<p>Although a cup of yogurt may not sound the most appetizing to drink,
			laban has a ton of health benefits, especially for probiotic health.</p>
			<h2>East and South Asian</h2>
			<p>Oolong tea, originating from Japan, has a unique taste from a blend of special
			oolong leaves. The calming tea tastes amazing on a rainy afternoon when
			curled up inside with a good book. </p>
			<p>Although boba originated in Taiwan, it is extremely popular worldwide, especially
			in the United States. On the University of Michigan campus alone, you can find over
			ten boba shops within a mile radius. </p>
			<p>Mango lassi has to hands-down be one of the best beverages ever made.
			The first time I had it, I was in love. I don't even like mangoes that 
			much, but the rich taste and smooth texture is to die for. </p>
			<h2>Central American</h2>
			<p>Originating from Mexico, horchata is a spiced-based drink with the main ingredient
			being cinnamon. Mixed with milk and ice, the beverage is perfect at any time of 
			the year, especially around the holidays after a hearty meal. </p>
			<p>Pinolillo is a sweet cornmeal drink from Nicaragua. The
			chocolatey undertones make this beverage great for dessert.</p>
			<p>Popular in Panama, chicheme is made from corn kernels, spices, and milk.
			Although there are variations across the country, La Chorrera is
			known for it.</p>
