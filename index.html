		<p>Hey there! My name is Grace Garmo, and I'm a sophomore at the University of Michigan
            studying User Experience (UX) Design in the <a href = "https://www.si.umich.edu/">U-M School of Information.</a>
			On campus, I'm involved in <a href = "https://ktpumich.com/index.html"> Kappa Theta Pi Professional Technology Fraternity</a>
			and <a href = "http://voidtechconsulting.com/">VOID Tech Consulting.</a>
			Through those two student organizations, I work to improve upon my design skills and work on
			awesome products like creating mobile apps and websites!
            When I'm not in class, I love trying out new foods from around the world -- thus, I decided to make
            this page and show off my favorite food and drinks!
        </p>

        <br>
		
		<p>Food has always been my love language, whether it be bonding over a delicious
			meal or trying (and failing) to cook one of my favorite dishes for someone. 
			On this site, I'll be showcasing my favorite foods and drinks from three regions:
            the Middle East, East and South Asia, and Central America. Hopefully, you'll
            discover a new favorite item and try it out for yourself!
